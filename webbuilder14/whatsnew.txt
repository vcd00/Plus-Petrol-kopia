What is new in WYSIWYG Web Builder 14?

Flex Grid
- New feature: WB14 introduces a new way of creating flexible layouts based on the new CSS Grid Layout. 
The CSS grid is a new technique in CSS that allows web developers to create complex responsive web design layouts more easily and consistently across browsers.

'CSS Grid Layout' is a two-dimensional grid system that is native to CSS. It does not rely on floats or other hacks. This result in clean code and reliable code.
The idea behind the Grid Layout is to divide a webpage into columns and rows. The columns and rows have named areas where you can drag & drop object in. The definition of the layout can be different for each breakpoint.
Each grid area supports it own padding, (flexbox) alignment, border and background style.

Cards
- New feature: Added 'Card' object. A card is a lightweight, flexible content container. It includes options for headers and footers, a wide variety of content, styling, and powerful display options.
When used in combination with a flexbox container, multiple cards with different content can have the same height, which normally would be difficult to achieve.
- New feature: Popovers, this basically uses the Card as an advanced tooltip/pop-up box that appears when the user clicks or hovers on an element.
