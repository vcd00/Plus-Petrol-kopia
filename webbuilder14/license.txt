This software was created to be free of defects and is designed to
function on PC computers only. While this software has been tested 
and proven to run accurately, in the unlikely event of any user or 
computer incompatibility issues, the end user assumes complete 
liability of usage. This software contains no adware, scumware or 
spyware. The maker of this software does not support any 
questionable forms of use where this software could be misused in 
any way. 

WARNING: The use of cracks or serial number generators can make your 
projects useless in the future. When using this software with an 
illegal license you'll risk losing all your hard work!
Also when you publish your website online created with illegal 
software you risk having your website closed due copyright infringement.

REFUND POLICY: Pablo Software Solutions products are all downloadable, 
fully functional, and try-before-you-buy. We provide a free 30 day 
trial version of our software for your convenience to fully evaluate 
in your computing environment. If you purchase one of our products, 
after your credit card or check is approved, an email will be sent to 
you with the activation key to unlock the software. 
Once this information is emailed to you, there will be no refunds given. 
We must enforce this policy since it would be impossible for you to 
return your registered version of our software. We strongly recommend 
that all users download, install, and test the fully functional trial 
versions prior to making a purchase. Once you have activated the software 
you will no longer qualify for a refund. Because there is no way to 
guarantee that our software was actually removed from a system after it is 
installed, this allows us to help fight fraudulent activity.

EXTENSIONS are made available as an extra service for registered users, 
they are not an official part of the software and therefor cannot be used 
in the trial version. Pablo Software Solutions will not offer 
support for third party extensions and is in no way responsible for 
proper functioning of these extensions.
